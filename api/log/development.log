Page replacement happens when a requested page is not in memory (page fault) and a free page cannot be used to satisfy the allocation, either because there are none, or because the number of free pages is lower than some threshold.\n\n## The clock page replacement algorithm\nThe clock page replacement algorithm keeps a circular list of slots in memory, with the iterator pointing at the last examined slot in the list. When a page fault occurs and no empty slots exist, the algorithm checks the R-bit (referenced) of the page pointed by the iterator: if the R-bit is 0 the page pointed is removed from the memory, the new page is inserted and the iterator is moved forward, else if the R-bit is 1 it is set to 0 and the iterator is moved forward (this process is repeated until a page with an R-bit equal to 0 is found). Note that the R-bit is set to 1 when a page that is already in memory is referenced again.<br>\n\nYour task is to implement this algorithm. The ```clock``` function will take two parameters as input: the number of maximum pages that can be kept in memory at the same time ```n``` and a ```reference list``` containing numbers. Every number represents a page request for a specific page (you can see this number as the unique ID of a page). The expected output is the status of the memory after the application of the algorithm. Note that when a page is inserted in the memory, it stays at the same position until it is removed from the memory by a page fault.\n\n## Example:\nThe circular list is represented as a normal list with toroidal behaviour. Given:\n  * N = 3,\n  * REFERENCE LIST = \\[6, 3, 6, 3, 2, 5, 1, 6\\],\n  \n```\n    +---+---+\n    |VAL| R |   * 6 is read, page fault\n    +---+---+   * 6 is inserted at position 0\n    | 6 | 0 |   * the iterator is moved forward\n    +---+---+\n--> |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    \n    +---+---+\n    |VAL| R |   * 3 is read, page fault\n    +---+---+   * 3 is inserted at position 1\n    | 6 | 0 |   * the iterator is moved forward\n    +---+---+\n    | 3 | 0 |\n    +---+---+\n--> |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    \n    +---+---+\n    |VAL| R |   * 6 is read, already in memory\n    +---+---+   * R-bit set to 1\n    | 6 | 1 |\n    +---+---+\n    | 3 | 0 |\n    +---+---+\n--> |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    \n    +---+---+\n    |VAL| R |   * 3 is read, already in memory\n    +---+---+   * R-bit set to 1\n    | 6 | 1 |\n    +---+---+\n    | 3 | 1 |\n    +---+---+\n--> |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    \n    +---+---+\n    |VAL| R |   * 2 is read, page fault\n    +---+---+   * 2 is inserted at position 2\n--> | 6 | 1 |   * the iterator is moved forward\n    +---+---+\n    | 3 | 1 |\n    +---+---+\n    | 2 | 0 |\n    +---+---+\n    \n    +---+---+\n    |VAL| R |   * 5 is read, page fault\n    +---+---+   * the R-bit of 6 is 1, we set it to 0 and move forward\n--> | 6 | 0 |   * the R-bit of 3 is 1, we set it to 0 and move forward\n    +---+---+   * the R-bit of 2 is 0, we remove it from memory\n    | 3 | 0 |   * 5 is inserted at position 2\n    +---+---+   * the iterator is moved forward\n    | 5 | 0 |\n    +---+---+\n    \n    +---+---+\n    |VAL| R |   * 1 is read, page fault\n    +---+---+   * the R-bit of 6 is 0, we remove it from memory\n    | 1 | 0 |   * 1 is inserted at position 0\n    +---+---+   * the iterator is moved forward\n--> | 3 | 0 |\n    +---+---+\n    | 5 | 0 |\n    +---+---+\n    \n    +---+---+\n    |VAL| R |   * 6 is read, page fault\n    +---+---+   * the R-bit of 3 is 0, we remove it from memory\n    | 1 | 0 |   * 6 is inserted at position 1\n    +---+---+   * the iterator is moved forward\n    | 6 | 0 |\n    +---+---+\n--> | 5 | 0 |\n    +---+---+\n    \n```\n\nSo, at the end we have the list ```[1, 6, 5]```, which is what you have to return. If not all the slots in the memory get occupied after applying the algorithm, fill the remaining slots (at the end of the list) with ```-1``` to represent emptiness (note that the IDs will always be >= 1).", "totalAttempts"=>501, "totalCompleted"=>116, "totalStars"=>14, "voteScore"=>60, "tags"=>["Algorithms", "Lists"], "contributorsWanted"=>true, "unresolved"=>{"issues"=>0, "suggestions"=>0}}

Page replacement happens when a requested page is not in memory (page fault) and a free page cannot be used to satisfy the allocation, either because there are none, or because the number of free pages is lower than some threshold.\n\n## The LRU page replacement algorithm\nThe least recently used (LRU) page replacement algorithm works on the idea that pages that have been most heavily used in the past few instructions are most likely to be used heavily in the next few instructions too. If not all the slots in memory are occupied, the requested page is inserted in the first available slot when  a page fault happens. If the memory is full and a page fault happens, the least recently used page in memory gets replaced by the requested page. To explain it in a clearer way: the least recently used page is the page that is currently in memory and has been referenced further in the past.<br>\n\nYour task is to implement this algorithm. The ```lru``` function will take two parameters as input: the number of maximum pages that can be kept in memory at the same time ```n``` and a ```reference list``` containing numbers. Every number represents a page request for a specific page (you can see this number as the unique ID of a page). The expected output is the status of the memory after the application of the algorithm. Note that when a page is inserted in the memory, it stays at the same position until it is removed from the memory by a page fault.\n\n## Example:\nGiven:\n  * N = 3,\n  * REFERENCE LIST = \\[1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 5\\],\n  \n```\n  * 1 is read, page fault --> free memory available, memory = [1];\n  * 2 is read, page fault --> free memory available, memory = [1, 2];\n  * 3 is read, page fault --> free memory available, memory = [1, 2, 3];\n  * 4 is read, page fault --> LRU = 1, memory = [4, 2, 3];\n  * 3 is read, already in memory, nothing happens;\n  * 2 is read, already in memory, nothing happens;\n  * 5 is read, page fault --> LRU = 4, memory = [5, 2, 3].\n```\n\nSo, at the end we have the list ```[5, 2, 3]```, which is what you have to return. If not all the slots in the memory get occupied after applying the algorithm, fill the remaining slots (at the end of the list) with ```-1``` to represent emptiness (note that the IDs will always be >= 1).\n", "totalAttempts"=>611, "totalCompleted"=>182, "totalStars"=>20, "voteScore"=>71, "tags"=>["Algorithms", "Lists"], "contributorsWanted"=>true, "unresolved"=>{"issues"=>0, "suggestions"=>0}}
